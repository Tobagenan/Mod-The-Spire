adding character, most of it is predone since used character template from the start
resources/YOURMODNAME/localization/eng/CharacterStrings.json
change name and other text info
most of everything is already done for character class by selecting the template
to the point where i can select character with details and get through first combat but crashes immediately bc not enough cards. epic

Help / tips: 
"Standard characters have a pool of 75 cards, in a ratio of approximately 1:2:1 Common:Uncommon:Rare.
You'll need at least 3 common, uncommon, and rare cards to avoid card rewards freezing/crashing the game, and two attacks, two skills, and one power for shops to not crash. If you pick up question card you'd need 4 of each rarity. Until you fill out the card pool, expect crashes during testing. You can use Prismatic Shard as the starting relic if you want to avoid dealing with this right away.

They have 1 starter relic, and some number of relics spread out in the common, uncommon, and rare pools. All basegame characters have 1 common relic. Watcher has 2 uncommon relics, the others have 1. Ironclad and Silent have 3 rare relics; Watcher has 2, and Defect has 1. Characters generally have 3 boss relics. 1 starter relic upgrade (please make yours better than the basegame upgrades), 1 non-energy relic, and 1 energy relic. Watcher only has 2 boss relics.

Focus more on cards than relics; character specific relics (besides the starter) are relatively uncommon to encounter and don't harm the experience too much if they're missing. But they do add a bit of nice variety to the gameplay since they can interact directly with character mechanics, unlike generic relics."
